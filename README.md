# MCP Server with Claude Cursor & Weather API Integration

This project is a custom **Minecraft Server (MCP)** designed to integrate with **Claude Cursor** for enhanced interaction through the command line interface (CLI), and it also utilizes a **Weather API** to provide real-time weather updates in the server.

## Features

- **MCP Server**: A fully functional Minecraft server setup.
- **Claude Cursor Integration**: Allows users to interact with the server through CLI commands, enhancing the server's user experience.
- **Weather API Integration**: Get real-time weather updates directly through the server’s command line.
  
## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install weather Server

1. **Download** the Minecraft server from the https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api.
2. **Extract** the downloaded file to your desired directory.
3. **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    java -jar minecraft_server.jar
    ```

### 2. Integrating Claude Cursor

1. **Install Claude Cursor**: Follow the installation instructions provided on [Claude Cursor's GitHub page](https://github.com/claude-cursor/claude-cursor).
2. **Set up the connection**: Ensure the server is linked to Claude Cursor by editing the configuration file.

### 3. Setup Weather API

1. **Create an account** on any Weather API provider like [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and get your API key.
2. **Add the API Key**: In your server config file, add your API key for weather data fetching.
   
### Example config snippet:
```bash
weather_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### 4. Run the Server

1. Once everything is configured, **start the Minecraft server**.
    ```bash
    java -jar minecraft_server.jar
    ```

2. **Execute Commands via CLI**:
    - To check the weather, use:
      ```bash
      /weather <city_name>
      ```

    - Claude Cursor will fetch the data from the Weather API and return the current weather information to the Minecraft server.

## Usage

- **Weather Command**: 
    Type `/weather <city_name>` to get real-time weather data in your Minecraft chat.
  
- **Custom Commands**: 
    You can extend the functionality by adding more commands via **Claude Cursor** integration. 

## Example Commands:

1. **Get Weather**:  
   Command: `/weather New York`  
   Output: `Current weather in New York: 72°F, Partly Cloudy`

2. **Send Custom Message via Claude Cursor**:  
   Command: `/sendmessage "Hello from Claude Cursor!"`

## Troubleshooting

- **MCP Server Crashes**: Ensure that you have the correct version of Java installed.
- **Weather API Not Responding**: Verify your API key is correctly placed and is still active.
